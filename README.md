# Developer Test

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

**Create a simple website that will be able to perform a search using the Search API for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.**

The output should be a web page that displays matching movies with their details (title, year, runtime and image) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word in the movie title from the list of colours and show it somewhere on the movie details (maybe as the background colour).

**Things we are looking for:**

- Use WordPress as your back end framework
- Use UnderStrap as your starter theme
- Use SCSS/Sass for any CSS (built into UnderStrap)*
- use of git 
- use of a database

**Optional functionality you may like to include:**

- Caching of search results
- Correct usage of framework elements (bootstrap)
- Mobile Responsiveness
- Lighthouse performance export

**Notes:**

Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation Instructions.
Create your website, commit it and then push it to Github
Email back a link to your completed code
You may build your function within UnderStrap, or within a custom plugin. Either way is fine.

All done!
